# ðŸ”„ CPU Scheduling Simulator

A simple and interactive **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool helps you visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms work and how they impact process performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project simulates common CPU scheduling algorithms, making it easier for students and developers to understand the concepts of process scheduling in operating systems. The user can input process details and select a scheduling algorithm to visualize how the CPU handles the processes.

## âœ¨ Features

- User-friendly interface
- Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority Scheduling
- Gantt chart for process execution visualization
- Displays:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting & Turnaround Time
- Built with a responsive design and modern UI styling

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the app
- **CSS** â€“ Styling (dark blue theme with cyan effects)
- **JavaScript** â€“ Core logic for scheduling algorithms and interaction handling
